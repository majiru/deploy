Deploy helps in the processes of running scripts on multiple hosts.

Running Deploy requires 2 parts. The config file that defines the connection
command and the script to run on the hosts.

The config file is a json file with the following fields:
	Cmd : Array of strings specifying the connection command.
		The special string {{HOST}} will be replaced with the hostname
		specified by the Host key.
	Hosts : Array of strings specifying the hosts to run the script on.
	Script : String specifying the location of the script to run on each host.

As an example the following is a valid configuration file:
{
        "Cmd": ["ssh", "root@{{HOST}}", "sh"],
        "Hosts": ["vpn", "irc"],
        "Script": "./deploy.sh"
}

Run deploy by just specifying one or more configuration files.
Ex.
	; ./deploy vms.json

Scripts are run concurrently with output being sent back to the host.
